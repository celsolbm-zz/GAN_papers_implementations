# GAN_papers_implementations

Implementation of GANS from various papers. Most of these notebooks doesnt need any extra data to run it, you can just download it and run on your local machine. I recomend though using CUDA or else its going to take a loooong time to train the models.

If you have any issues regarding the dataset just change download = True on the mnist imported dataset.

I will be constantly updating this repo with new implementations and enhancements to the already implemented here GANs
